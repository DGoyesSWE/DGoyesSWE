- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Goyes, @DGoyesSWE on GitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in video/boardgames, languages, nature, hiking, traveling, volleyball, reading, and education.
- 🌱 I’m currently on a journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer with the #100Devs Bootcamp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Tech projects related to education/learning, languages and trading (i.e. create my own trading robot), and some projects that make life easiers (things like Automate the Boring Stuff)
- 📫 I'm documenting my journey mainly on Twitter @DGoyes89
